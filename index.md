title: The Beginning
---

I have always had a knack for working out machines. I have used Ubuntu LTS as my main desktop for over 10 years now, and feel like I know my way around it pretty well. I'm no expert for sure. Not even really confident I would consider myself intermediate by most peoples standards, but I can get the job done. I worked in technical support for a large telco in Australia for over 10 years. Half that time I was customer facing fixing endless support calls for mobile and internet customers as both level 1 and level 2 support. The other half I worked as a process engineer (similar to a business analyst) designing and managing change of our assurance processes to support our customers. I feel like it's time for a change. I have felt very lost since I finished at that job in 2018 and have never really found 'the next thing', but I really think tech is my home and I would like to be able to build things of my own. The thing is, I have never felt confident with code. I have tried a whole bunch of 'hello, worlds', game engines etc, but none of it has ever felt like it's stuck. Right now I'm self employed and taking Harvard's CS50x and then I'll move on to some of their other courses. Let's get going!!!
